Classification of Covid-19 documents: Comparing Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning techniques with transformers

The year 2020 changed our lives forever. Covid-19, an unknown term until then, became the new reality of our lives. With very little information available about this
virus, there was an urgent need for knowledge that would help in dealing with this deadly pandemic. And experts from various fields did respond to this need. Various
documents regarding Covid-19 transmission, prevention, diagnosis etc were being published with great urgency. But with such an outpour of data, the need of the
hour was an effective automated document classification technique that could accurately classify any given Covid-19 related document, the research for which is still in progress. Through this project, I wanted to compare the efficiency and accuracy of document classification by supervised and unsupervised machine learning models with well-known NLP transformers. This is done by comparing the accuracy and microF1 scores of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques with the latest transformer models. My project is based on the research findings by B. J. Gutierrez et al.(B. J. Gutierrez, J. Zeng, D. Zhang, P. Zhang, and Y. Su. Document classification for covid-19 literature, 2020) who have compared various machine learning, neural network and artificial intelligence models for document classification of Covid-19 literature, back in 2020.
